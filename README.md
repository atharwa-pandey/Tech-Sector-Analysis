**Stock Selection and Portfolio Optimization in the Technology Sector**

Overview

This project analyzes the performance of key technology stocks and sector-wide trends during 2017–2022. Using advanced financial engineering techniques, we construct and evaluate portfolios to optimize risk-adjusted returns while assessing their performance under different market conditions.

Key Objectives
	1.	Stock Selection: Identify influential technology companies for comprehensive sector representation.
	2.	Portfolio Optimization: Implement mean-variance and tangency portfolio strategies to maximize returns and minimize risk.
	3.	Risk Analysis: Evaluate market sensitivity (CAPM) and risk measures (VaR, ES) for the sector and portfolios.

Selected Stocks
	•	Amazon (AMZN): Leader in cloud computing and e-commerce.
	•	Microsoft (MSFT): Dominant in enterprise software and cloud services.
	•	Apple (AAPL): Pioneer in consumer electronics and digital ecosystems.
	•	Google (GOOGL): Key player in digital advertising and artificial intelligence.

Methodology
	1.	Data Analysis:
	•	Historical data from 2017–2022.
	•	NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index (NDXT) as the benchmark.
	2.	Portfolio Construction:
	•	Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP): Focuses on risk minimization.
	•	Tangency Portfolio: Maximizes the Sharpe Ratio using a 2% risk-free rate.
	3.	Risk Assessment:
	•	CAPM: Measures market sensitivity through alpha and beta.
	•	VaR and ES: Non-parametric methods for quantifying risk.

Key Findings
	1.	Portfolio Performance (2017–2019):
	•	Tangency Portfolio achieved a Sharpe Ratio of 1.643, outperforming the sector’s 0.957.
	•	MSFT demonstrated the best risk-return trade-off with a Sharpe Ratio of 1.419.
	2.	Impact of COVID-19 (2020–2022):
	•	Increased volatility caused higher VaR and ES values across assets.
	•	Tangency Portfolio maintained better risk-adjusted returns compared to the sector.
	3.	CAPM Insights:
	•	The Tangency Portfolio outperformed CAPM-predicted returns, suggesting model limitations in capturing optimized portfolios.

Conclusion

This study highlights the effectiveness of portfolio optimization techniques in balancing risk and return in the dynamic technology sector. The findings underscore the importance of diversification and strategic allocation during periods of heightened market uncertainty.
